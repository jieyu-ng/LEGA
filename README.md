## Challenge and Approach 
- Time Management Was Tough: We had to make some hard calls about what to build and what to leave out. Instead of trying to build ten half-working features, we focused on making one complete workflow work really well
- Mentor Feedback Changed Our Approach: About halfway through, we got some feedback from our mentor that made us rethink our architecture. So we pivoted to add more deterministic validation and audit capabilities.
